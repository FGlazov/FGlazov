Hi! I'm Fedor Glazov, I work as a Data Scientist at Dataqube GmbH.

In my spare time, I typically work on mantaining and updating a data aggregation system for the video game IL-2 Sturmovik.
It automatically reads in the output of a multiplayer server, and aggregates the best players, best planes, and so on. The results
are then displayed on a website frontend. Popular instances of this system can be found here:
- http://stats.virtualpilots.fi:8000/en/ 
- https://combatbox.net/en/

I'm interested in operations research, discrete optimization, and image processing.

Feel free to contact me on this Github or via <first name><last name>@gmail.com.
